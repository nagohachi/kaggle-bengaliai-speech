You can refer to this [dataset]()\n","\n","Public models from hugging faces:\n","* `https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/indicwav2vec_v1_bengali` for Wav2vec2CTC Model only\n","* `https://huggingface.co/arijitx/wav2vec2-xls-r-300m-bengali` for Language Model\n","\n","I didn't trained these models using the competitaion data at all. I just want to know public models score as baseline.  \n","\n","So we may get higher and higher score by fine-tuning on competition data.\n","\n","**Note: I only finetuned the indicwav2vec_v1_bengali which is a CTC model. I am still using the public LM model mentioned above.**\n","\n","\n","### Everything above PLUS\n","\n","- How to find the best decoding params using optuna on valid dataset.\n","\n","It's being suggested by the authors of the [pyctcdecode](https://github.com/kensho-technologies/pyctcdecode/tree/main) developers that we should perform a parameter search because it can improve our results on a specific tasks other than English such as ours.\n","\n","> (Note: pyctcdecode contains several free hyperparameters that can strongly influence error rate and wall time. Default values for these parameters were (merely) chosen in order to yield good performance for one particular use case. For best results, especially when working with languages other than English, users are encouraged to perform a hyperparameter optimization study on their own data.)\n","\n","So we will give it a try to find the best parameters in the validation split of the train dataset (because of the time constraints we will only use 5k). Here are the list of decoding params for easy access:\n","\n","```python\n","# from: https://github.com/kensho-technologies/pyctcdecode/blob/main/pyctcdecode/constants.py\n","# default parameters for
